# ikr

*From ignorance, lead me to truth*

It's [idk][] for when you actually *know*.

A more serious and decent take on the idea of lists of items that can be voted on.

## Why

It's a short "shitty webapp" project like [idk][] (two hours so far).

I realized I've been doing some sort of personal idea voting system in a
notepad. Etherpad, specifically. I'm trying to move away from pads, but the
TODO list software i'm using can't handle this kind of prioritization very
well, so i said "fuck it, i know i **can** make one myself in one hour or so."

Being able to say that is a sign that idk was a success, by the way.

## Features

 * Multiple lists
 * Javascript voting
 * Actually supports real databases through [dataset][] (defaults to sqlite)
 * Random list name generator for shallow privacy
 * General purpose
 * Less insanity, in general
 * Votes still lack any kind of rate limiting, though

## Is it any good?
